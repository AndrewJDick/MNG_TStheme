# MNG_TStheme
A dark re-skin for the Teamspeak client (Windows or OSX only at the moment, I may implement Linux at a later date).

##To install: 

### Locate TeamSpeak's styles folder:
Windows: C:/Program Files/TeamSpeak 3 Client/styles/
Mac: /Applications/TeamSpeak 3 Client.app/Contents/SharedSupport/styles/

### Place files into the folder
Place the following items into the styles folder:
	- MNG [folder containing chat_tab.png & info_frame.png]
	- default_chat.qss (Choose to replace the previous version - remember to backup this file if you wish to revert!)
	- MNG_mac.qss
	- MNG.qss

### Apply the MNG theme in TeamSpeak Settings > Design

### Restart the client.
